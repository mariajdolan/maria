<p>Woodlouse has a particularly strong affinity with the colour <span 
class="purple">grey</span> which affects the clothes he buys.</p>
<p class="purple">It was therefore a great shame when purple saturated 
the clothing dye market and so the production of grey pigments became a 
niche endeavour with low fiscal benefit.</p>
